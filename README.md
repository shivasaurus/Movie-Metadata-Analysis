# Movie-Metadata-Analysis
Contains analysis of the relationship between genre, box office, awards, and seasonality

This project was done for the course Intro to Digital Humanities at Princeton University. It contains visualizations of the relationships 
between genre, awards, and box office (for example, which genres are most overrepresented at the Oscars relative to their box office shares)
along with visualizations of the relationship between genre and seasonality (for example, which genres have the greatest box office share in each month).
